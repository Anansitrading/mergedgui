# Plan 05-03: Infrastructure Tests & Final Hardening

## Objective
Comprehensive test coverage for infrastructure components and final hardening.

## Tasks
1. Health endpoint tests (liveness, readiness, dependency checks)
2. Rate limiting tests (config, IP extraction, memory fallback)
3. Docker configuration tests (file existence, service definitions)
4. CORS configuration tests (preflight, localhost origin)
5. Route coverage tests (minimum routes, all routers mounted)
6. Updated .gitignore for Python artifacts

## Dependencies
- All infrastructure code from 05-01 and 05-02

## Verification
- [ ] All 15 infrastructure tests pass
- [ ] Full test suite: 70 passed, 13 skipped, 0 failures
- [ ] 82+ API routes registered
