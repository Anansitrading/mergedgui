## Session Log

### 2026-02-10 — Overnight Sprint Init
- Oracle initialized Swarm-GSD project
- PROJECT.md created from implementation plan + dependency analysis
- Research synthesized from existing documentation (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls)
- 101 requirements defined across 12 categories
- 5-phase roadmap created with Linear ticket mappings
- NotebookLM auth expired — hivemind deferred
- All P0 fixes already in-flight (KIJ-402 XSS fix, KIJ-408 devDeps)

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Backend in server/ subdirectory of Kijko-MVP | Init | One repo for frontend+backend integration |
| Skip research agents, synthesize directly | Init | Implementation plan already constitutes research |
| YOLO mode with comprehensive depth | Init | Overnight sprint, maximize throughput |
| Parallel execution enabled | Init | Independent domain routers can be built simultaneously |
